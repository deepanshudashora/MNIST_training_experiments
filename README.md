# Problem Statement

Train CNN on MNIST dataset as :

- 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
- Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
- Less than 8000 Parameters

# Folder Structure

- Module 1 (Basics Done)

  * Contains The basic architecture which has less than 8000 parameters just to satisfy the problem statement basic needs
  * We future introduce dropout as well
- Module 2 (Architecture Improvments)

  * We go ahead any try to fix our architecture so we can start getting closer to the accuracy goal
  * This includes both chaging the layer structure as well as playing with learning rate schedulers
- Module 3 (Final Results)

  * Contains Code with accived target code
  * Also future parameters are reduced and accuracy is mantained

# File Structure

* model.py
  * Contains Model Architecture
* utils.py
  * Contains all the functions which are required to initiate the training
    * Contains data augmentation
    * Test and Train functions
    * Plotting Misclassified results and random prediction code
    * Contains code for plotting the accuracy and loss plot on test and train set
* **.ipynb
  * contains execution of imports from these files
  * One file which compiles down all the code required for training
* logs/
  * collects logs from each and every file
  * mainly used for collecting loss and accuracy during training
* .gitignore
  * For not pushing the unnecessary things available in code folder

The Base target is to make a architecture which has less than 8000 parameters, In this stage we do not consider any points for accuracy, Batch Normalization is alredy done since we know we need to introduce it furture.                                     |
